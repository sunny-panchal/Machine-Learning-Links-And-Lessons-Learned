# Machine Learning Links And Lessons Learned
A summary of the resources I have come across and the lessons I have learned while studying machine learning. I've been Inspired to organize my findings by Adit Deshpande's work found on his repo [here](https://github.com/adeshpande3). I've included some general coding and full-stack development related content as well that I'll add to it's own file later.
